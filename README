Mostly Common Lisp code for building Quicklisp "dists" with some
helper shell scripts.

This is currently tied to my personal setup: I use update-archives to
generate .tgz archives out of the individual git archives of my own
libraries.

The Lisp function COMPILE-DIST takes the name of a file containing a
DEFINE-DIST form (see monkeylib.dist for an example) and then builds
the three files required by Quicklisp in an appropriate directory.
